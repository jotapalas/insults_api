# Welcome to Mele√© Island!
This is a simple project that started as part of a training, just for learning purposes. But while I was learning I thought: "Why not make this fun?". So I started *insults_api*.

## About the routes and API usage
If you just want to use the API without contributing to its development, you can make calls to these routes. Every route returns a JSON object related with insults in some way or another:

- [*/insults*](https://angular-vortex-230208.appspot.com/api/insults): Get all the insults for every sword fight.
- [*/comebacks*](https://angular-vortex-230208.appspot.com/api/comebacks): Get just the comebacks for the insults.
- [*/all*](https://angular-vortex-230208.appspot.com/api/all): Get every insult with every one of its comebacks!

## About the code
The project is built on [Python 2](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-272/), using [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) framework, so you'll need to install some dependencies if you want to clone this one and help me defeat the [Sword Master](https://monkeyisland.fandom.com/wiki/Carla_the_Sword_Master). A [virtual environment](https://docs.python-guide.org/dev/virtualenvs/) is recommended for this. Also, you can use `pip install -r requirements.txt` to get things in place.

The structure is really simple and kinda self explanatory: *main.py* is the main entry point, while *get_data.py* is just a helpful module to get things in place. The insults are stored in [Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/) and the final app is deployed to [Google App Engine](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/) using the configuration in *app.yaml*
